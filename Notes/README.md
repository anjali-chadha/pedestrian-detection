1. Four kind of sensors used by driver assistance systems.
    * Normal cameras
        * Used in day light conditions
        * Sensitive to lightening conditions
    * Infra-red camers
        * Used for Night time systems
        * Expensive
        * Low Resolution
    * Laser scanners
    * Radars
    
2. Conventional two-step approach 
    * Selection step:
      
      Objects are separated with an adaptive threshold image segmentation algorithm
      
      Methods Like
        * Image Segmentation
        * Stereovision
        * Edge Extraction
    * Recognition step:
        *  Size, position and shape feature of the objects are used in classifying. 
3. More drawbacks of Infrared videos
    * In winter, pedestrians often wear heavy clothes, so only their heads can be seen in infrared videos.It is difficult to recognize a pedestrian only by the shape of his head
    * While in summer, the temperature of pedestriansâ€™ body is close to the environment temperature. It is difficult to separate them from the background
